## üß™ Testing with Sample Data

The repository includes real CPT test data files in the `test_data/` folder:

```bash
# After running the app, upload any of these files:
test_data/sample_cpt1.txt  # 1 layer, uniform soft soil
test_data/sample_cpt2.txt  # 5 layers, 1,930mm settlement ‚≠ê Recommended
test_data/sample_cpt3.txt  # 1 layer, shorter profile
```

**Quick Test:**
1. Start the app: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Go to "üì§ Upload CPT Data" tab
3. Upload `test_data/sample_cpt2.txt`
4. Navigate to "Settlement Analysis" tab
5. Click "Calculate Settlement" to see ~1,930mm total settlement results!

See [test_data/README.md](test_data/README.md) for detailed information about each sample file.

- Choose profile type (qc, Rf, u2, Qt, Ic)
- Compare multiple CPTs side-by-side

### 4. Explore Soil Classification
- View Robertson (2009) classification charts
- See soil type distribution
- Analyze Ic contours

### 5. Review Soil Layers
- View automated layer identification
- Export layer data
- Adjust layer thickness parameters if needed

### 6. Analyze Correlations
- Review calculated parameters for each layer
- Compare E, Cc, Cr, OCR across layers
- Export complete analysis to Excel

### 7. Calculate Settlement
- Input loading configuration:
  - Applied load (kN)
  - Footing dimensions (m)
  - Footing depth (m)
- View immediate and consolidation settlement
- Export settlement results and PDF reports

## Test Data Files

Real CPT field data is included in the `test_data/` folder for testing:
- `sample_cpt1.txt` - 1 layer organic clay profile (0mm settlement)
- `sample_cpt2.txt` - 5 layer profile showing significant settlement (1,930mm) ‚≠ê
- `sample_cpt3.txt` - Single layer profile with shorter depth range (0mm settlement)

All files are tab-delimited format: Depth | qc | fs | u2

See [test_data/README.md](test_data/README.md) for complete details.

## Methodology

### Soil Classification
Based on **Robertson (2009)** normalized CPT methodology:
- Normalized cone resistance: Qt = (qt - œÉvo) / œÉ'vo
- Normalized friction ratio: Fr = [fs / (qt - œÉvo)] √ó 100%
- Soil behavior type index: Ic = ‚àö[(3.47 - log Qt)¬≤ + (log Fr + 1.22)¬≤]

### Correlations
Settlement parameters derived from published correlations:
- **E**: Œ±_E √ó (qt - œÉvo), where Œ±_E = 0.015 √ó 10^(0.55√óIc + 1.68)
- **Cc**: Based on plasticity index correlations (Jain et al. 2015)
- **Cr**: GMDH-type neural network (Kordnaeij et al. 2015)
- **OCR**: k √ó (qt / œÉ'vo), where k varies with soil type
- **M**: Œ±_M √ó qt, where Œ±_M varies with Qtn

### Settlement Calculations
- **Immediate Settlement**: S = Œ£(ŒîœÉ √ó H / E) for each layer
- **Consolidation Settlement**: Terzaghi's theory with Cc and Cr
- Accounts for over-consolidation and stress history

## Notes

- The app performs calculations based on empirical correlations which have limitations
- Results should be verified by qualified geotechnical engineers
- Engineering judgment is required for final design decisions
- Parameters may need adjustment based on local experience and soil conditions
